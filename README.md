# How To Play

Paint on the canvas and balance the 4 colors in the palette as many times as you can before time runs out. The ratio of colors is shown in the bar above the canvas; match the ratios of the 4 colors as show in the top bar to score 1 point.

## 1-Player Mode

Use the mouse to move your brush and the 1 2 3 and 4 keys to paint each color.

## 4-Player Mode

In 4-Player Mode, each player has their own brush shape and controls 1 of the 4 colors.

You need to map keyboard presses to other inputs, since it's not ergonomic for four people to play on one keyboard.

Here are the controls for each player on the keyboard.

| Player | Up | Down | Left | Right | Paint |
| ------ | -- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| 1      | W  | S    | A    | D     | Q     |
| 2      | I  | K    | J    | L     | U     |
| 3      | Z  | X    | C    | V     | B     |
| 4      | 9  | 0    | -    | =     | 8     |
